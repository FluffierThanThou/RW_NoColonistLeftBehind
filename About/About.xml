Allows assigning colonists' animals to be designated and put into cryptosleep caskets, so you don't have to leave your trusty companions behind.

  - Adds designator for mass-putting animals in caskets (found in Orders, requires CCL to be loaded)
  - Adds a Large Cryptosleep Casket, so you can take pet Thrumbos with you
  - Adds a Small Cryptosleep Casket, kittens really don't need that much space
  - Adds a button to cryptosleep caskets to manually assign animals to specific caskets
